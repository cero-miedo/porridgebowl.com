I was underwhelmed with iPhone X. Face ID had a high failure rate whenever I tried to use it in the mornings. I think there was maybe a problem with my glasses and the refractions of the light just didn't work.

I tried to make the iPhone X work for me. Apple's Geniuses told me to give it time. I did. It didn't get better, and they were unwilling to offer me a refund or exchange. It's the only time I've felt burned by Apple.

If Face ID is here to stay, I'm hoping for a more robust implementation. Touch ID integration is probably a long shot for 2019 phones, but I'd love to see it make a return.

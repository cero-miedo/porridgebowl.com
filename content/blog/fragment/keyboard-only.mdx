I've had a Repetitive Strain Injury in my right arm for about four years now. It flares up, grumbles for a bit until I try and correct it, before it dies down to a tolerable level.

Being a full-time computer user for work, I try my best to keep good posture. I've spent a lot of money on ergonomic mice over the years, tried various keyboards as well as undergoing physical therapies.

If you touch the area around your elbow joint, you'll notice that it's quite cold. Blood flow to this area isn't great, which is bad if you're waiting for an injury to heal.

I took a step back and realised, that throughout the course of a normal day, I was switching between keyboard and mouse dozens, if not hundreds of times. Could the action of simply reaching for the ergonimic mouse be causing the wince of pain? 

Conversing with colleagues, I learned of the wonderful world of keymap extensions for web-browsers.

[Enter Saka Key](https://key.saka.io/docs/about/introduction)

>Saka Key is a browser extension that lets you map keys on your keyboard to common browser tasks. It waits for you to press a key, then executes the appropriate action. This action might be scrolling a page, switching tabs, or clicking a link.

MacOS has a lot of pretty useful accessiblity options pertaining to the keyboard. I've gone in and tweaked some of those shortcuts, so I can hit `^ + f` to access the MacOS menubar.

Other tools that are worth looking at: [Divvy](https://mizage.com/divvy/) for window management. I have this bound to `⌥ + Space` then `1` to place the active window on the left half of the screen. `2` puts it on the right, and `3` is 100% width, but not the same as `⌘ + f`.

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) replaced Spotlight for me a long time ago. I have it bound to `⌘ + Space`. File searches, custom workflows, even [pairing my Airpods](https://github.com/xz/airpods) can be triggered.

Not all of my work can be done without a mouse, but I'm hoping that by reducing the repetitive, outward reaching movements that I'm making, that pain will subside.

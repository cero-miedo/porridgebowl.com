It's been a long time since I've written any front-end code. This week, I've been experimenting with flexbox and rem units. Modern CSS has a very different feel to it. 

There's a familiarity, but it feels much more mature. The features we dreamed of are now there, ready to be used in primetime projects. It's a very fun medium, and one I get an enormous sense of pride from.

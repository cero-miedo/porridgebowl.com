It was the summer time. I was sitting in the back seat. On my own. Waiting for my Dad to come back. He was in Texas DIY buying stuff. My Dad was making a kitchen for our house. He wasn't putting a kitchen in, he was making it all himself, from scratch. Cabinets, doors, tiling, electrics, staining the wood, putting the floor down. Everything himself. I would help, but I wasn't really helping. I was just there.

So here I was, sitting in the back of the car, outside Texas DIY. The seats were grey suede. Soft. If you brushed it with your finger, you could see the path taken.

He came back with wood glue. It was in a green bottle and took ages to set.
